              Hello There! Welcome to my portfolio, and thank you for taking the
              time to explore it. I'm Cart Valderama, a{" "}
              <strong className="font-bold">frontend developer</strong> based in{" "}

              I like working on the frontend but I can handle some backend as
              well if needed. My approach to work mainly involves creating a web
              layout that is both simple and intuitive enough to accommodate a
              wide range of users. In order to backed this approach, I use my
              solid foundation in technologies such as <i>HTML</i>,

              So this time, I've added more interactivity and showcased some of
              my personality to create a more engaging experience and give a
              better sense of who I am, without being as boring as the previous
              one.

              I really hope you enjoy exploring this version of my personal
              portfolio as much as I enjoyed designing and creating it.

          <div className="row-start-2">
            <p>
              My main educational journey began after moving to Norway. I had to
              repeat highschool because my senior highschool diploma from the
              Philippines was not recognized by universities in Norway.
            </p>
            <p>
              After obtaining the required general competence at Stabekk
              Videreg√•ende Skole in 2020, I continued my studies at Oslo
              Metropolitan University, where I pursued a{" "}
              <strong className="font-bold">Bachelor's Degree</strong> in{" "}
              <strong className="font-bold">Information Technology</strong> and
              graduated in 2024 .
            </p>
          </div>
          <div className="row-span-3">
            <p>
              Current, I'm taking my{" "}
              <strong className="font-bold">
                Master's Degree in Universal Design of ICT
              </strong>{" "}
              at the same institution.
            </p>
            <p>
              Outside of academics, I have completed certifications from
              freeCodeCamp, which are Web Responsive Design in 2023 and
              JavaScript Legacy (both the main and beta versions) in 2024.
            </p>
            <h3 className="text-3xl my-1">I'm Fluent In</h3>
            <p>
              I can speak Filipino (Tagalog) and am proficient in English (US).
              While I prefer to speak and converse in English in work, I have
              B1-level proficiency in Norwegian, which I
            </p>
          </div>
          <div className="row-span-3">
            <p> use mainly for reading important documents.</p>
            <h3 className="text-3xl my-1">My Hobbies</h3>
            <p>
              Outside of coding web interfaces, I have a strong interest in
              sports, especially basketball. Moving to Norway, a non-nasketball
              country, made it challenging to continue this hobby at first.
              Fortunately, I found and joined Filipino basketball leagues.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another thing I enjoy is barbecuing. I usually do it during the
              summer, but if I really crave it, I'll even barbecue during the
              cold Norwegian winter.
