              Hello There! Welcome to my portfolio, and thank you for taking the
              time to explore it. I'm Cart Valderama, a{" "}

              I prefer working on the frontend but I can handle some backend as
              well if needed. My approach to work mainly involves creating a web
              layout that is both simple and intuitive enough to accommodate a
              wide range of users. In order to backed this approach, I use my
              solid foundation in technologies such as <i>HTML</i>, <i>CSS</i>,{" "}
              <i>JavaScript</i>,

              interactivity and showcased some of my personality to create a

          <h3 className="col-span-1 text-3xl my-1">Education</h3>
          <div className="row-start-2">
            <p>
              My main educational journey began after moving to Norway. Why only
              began here? Because my senior highschool diploma from the
              Philippines was not recognized by universities in Norway, so I had
              to repeat highschool here, which caused some delays.
            </p>
            <p>
              After obtaining the required general qualifications at Stabekk
              Videreg√•ende Skole in 2020, I continued my studies at Oslo
              Metropolitan University, where I pursued a{" "}
              <strong className="font-bold">Bachelor's Degree</strong> in{" "}
              <strong className="font-bold">
                Information Technology and graduated in 2024
              </strong>
              . Currently,

          <div className="row-span-3">
            <p>
              I am continuing my studies with a{" "}
              <strong className="font-bold">Master's Degree</strong> in{" "}
              <strong className="font-bold">Universal Design of ICT</strong> at
              the same institution, where I am learning more about
              accessibility.
            </p>
            <p>
              Outside of academics, I have completed several certifications from
              freeCodeCamp.org, including Web Responsive Design in 2023 and
              JavaScript Legacy (both the main and beta versions) in 2024.
            </p>
            <h3 className="text-3xl my-1">I'm Fluent In</h3>
            <p>
              I can speak Filipino (Tagalog) and am proficient in English (US).
              While I prefer to speak and converse in English in work, I have
              B1-level proficiency in Norwegian,
            </p>
          </div>
          <div className="row-span-3">
            <p> which I use mainly for reading and writing.</p>
            <h3 className="text-3xl my-1">My Hobbies</h3>
            <p>
              Outside of coding web interfaces, I have a strong interest in
              sports, especially basketball. Moving to Norway, a non-nasketball
              country, made it challenging to continue this hobby at first.
              Fortunately, I found and joined Filipino basketball leagues, which
              made it easier to play with others.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another thing I enjoy is barbecuing. I usually do it during the
              summer, but if I really crave it, I'll even barbecue during the
              cold Norwegian winter.
